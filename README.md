# esp32_scoring_device_hardware
Hardware files for the [low cost scoring device based on a esp32 development board](https://github.com/pietwauters/esp32-scoring-device/wiki)

You can use the same hardware to make an accurate [wire / weapon tester](https://github.com/pietwauters/WeaponWireTester). (You only have to replace the 470 Ohm resitors by 47 Ohm resistor) See: https://github.com/pietwauters/WeaponWireTester
